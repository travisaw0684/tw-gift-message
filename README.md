WooCommerce TW Gift Message Plugin
Overview
This plugin adds a gift message text field (max 150 characters) to WooCommerce single product pages. The gift message is saved and displayed through the WooCommerce cart, checkout, order, and email flow. It includes a custom admin column in the WooCommerce orders list and a JavaScript character counter for the input field, styled with plain CSS.

Assumptions and Limitations

Assumes WooCommerce is active and compatible with the current WordPress version.
The gift message is stored per cart/order item, so multiple items may have different messages.
Uses plain CSS for styling to keep the plugin lightweight; further styling can be customized via theme CSS.
The admin column truncates long messages to 50 characters to avoid layout issues.
No settings page is included due to time constraints; the max length (150) is hardcoded.
JavaScript assumes jQuery is available (standard with WooCommerce).

Potential Improvements

Add a settings page to configure max characters or enable/disable the feature.
Support for multiple gift messages per order with a more complex UI.
Add localization for multi-language support.
Enhance performance for large order volumes (see below).

Performance Optimization for 10,000+ Orders
To handle 10,000+ orders efficiently:

Index Database: Add an index to the woocommerce_order_itemmeta table for the gift message key to speed up queries.
Cache Data: Use transients or object caching to store frequently accessed gift message data, reducing database load.
Lazy Load Admin Data: Fetch gift message data for the admin column via AJAX to minimize initial page load time.
Optimize Queries: Use direct database queries for admin column rendering to avoid looping through order items.
